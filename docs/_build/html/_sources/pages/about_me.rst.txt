Why am I interested in this role?
=================================

First of all, I have most of the skills required for the role, such as an understanding of the command line interface and of the git workflow. However, I have never written a documentation through **Sphinx** and **ReadTheDocs** and would therefore benefit from this experience as I may create projects in the future that will require some clear documentation in order to be used by others. As a matter of fact, I have created an **API** regarding an artificial intelligence project for university that would gain from having an elegant documentation (1). Besides, once I heard of **ReadTheDocs**, my curiosity got the best of me, so I read through its documentation and created a little project of my own to familiarize myself with the framework (2). Finally, the supercomputer **Oswald** itself piqued my interest and I would gladly learn more about its operation.
